					p While attending Ray Elder's Interaction Design class, I was able to get a feel for Everythird's style of high calibur design and work. I feel like I would be a good fit for Everythird based on my design&nbsp;experience.

					p As you'll notice by my 
						a.indirect(href="#" data-left="-200%"  data-col="3") work experience
						| , I have a couple of years of experience developing and designing. I've made myself valuable by being able to communicate well with both designers and engineers: explaining typography to developers and mobile constraints to&nbsp;designers.

					p While studying graphic design at 
						span.sc BYU
						| , I took it upon myself to learn meticulous front end development practices to take my prototypes and presentations to the next level. I was able to communicate transition, animation, and movement to developers at the 
						span.sc BYU
						|  Center for Teaching and Learning with clean and&nbsp;reusable 
						span.sc CSS. 
					p My internship at Riser Agency allowed me to work with several different clients and projects with an goal-oriented timelines. These aggressive timelines assured that I worked efficiently and was always on my toes. I always hit my goals at Riser, and you can be assured that I would do the same at Everythird.
					p I would like to express my sincere enthusiasm for beginning my career at Everythird. I have strived to make an impact while at school by being an active participant of the 
						span.sc BYU 
						|  User Experience Design Club and directly working on the websites of four on-campus groups (Learning Suite, Museum of Art, 
						span.sc BYU 
						|  Tickets, 
						span.sc BYU
						|   Humanities). I recognize the reputation that Everythird has for delivering stellar products, and I hope to bring this same impact to your team. I appreciate your consideration for this&nbsp;opportunity.
